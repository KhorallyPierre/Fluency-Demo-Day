# Fluency-Demo-Day

Welcome to my Demo Day project! In honor of my love of languages and learning, I've created an application where members can video chat with individuals fluent in the language that they would like to learn. Members get rated based on their level of helpfulness. The more helpful a user it, the higher the score displayed on their profile. These individuals get preferred matches, which encourage users to be as helpful as possible. The idea is to help others learn a new language while also using them as a resource to do the same. Users spend half the session in one language, and the other half in the other language.

# Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. More specifically, I used MongoDB to store the documents storing the randomization of user interactions (I incorporated Math.floor(Math.random())) into my CRUD.



# Lessons Learned:

3/14 - struggled a bit but created my own middleware to make sure that users get notified of when someone is ready to chat as they navigate the website

3/16 - finally got users to pair using mongoDB document "waiting"

3/17 - working on buttons so that user status appears on profile

4/1 - created feature that prevents users from having more than one active chat at a time.

4/5 - worked on trash button to make functional (will circle back to this)

4/10 - implemented imbedded JS in my profile.ejs page to build out conditionals pertaining to chatting options

4/14 - Added some cool css styling to my sign-up page 
Nothing in tech is daunting as long as you make it fun! I love learning new languages (fun fact: I speak three languages, one of which I learned studying abroad) so using this theme has really made me feel like I'm actually making a difference in the lives of those around me that are passionate about language learning like I am.
